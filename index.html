        Some applications experience segmentation faults at the thought of
        having to explain something, but not <em>adam</em>. He genuinely enjoys teaching
        others what he knows, and has frequently been known to answer simple
        questions of syntax or usage with short essays covering a variety of use
        cases, pros, cons, and pitfalls.

        Comes pre-configured with a number of team- and project-management

        <em>adam</em> is lives and breathes music, covering a wide range from classical
        to jazz to folk to death metal, though he will happily admit to being
        particularly fond of anything associated with the 1980s. He is a capable
        guitarist and amateur mixing engineer, and laments not having the living
        space in which to build his own instruments and amplifiers.

    <em class="offset-anchor" id="--dog-lover">--dog-lover</em>
        Comes pre-configured with one or more Boston Terriers, because Boston
        Terriers are one of mankind's greatest achievements.

    <em class="offset-anchor" id="--shameless-geek">--shameless-geek</em>
        <em>adam</em> is a voracious consumer of science fiction, fantasy, and horror.
        He particularly enjoys the work of Douglas Adams, H.P. Lovecraft, John
        Carpenter, and Tim Burton, loves Star Trek, and considers The Expanse
        to be one of the best television shows in recent years.

        <em>adam</em> is easily diverted for hours at a time chasing obscure
        topics down Wikipedian rabbit holes.

        <em>adam</em> would happily pay a large sum of money in order to visit
        a lava lake up close.
