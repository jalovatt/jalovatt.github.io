      <em>adam</em> lives and breathes music, covering a wide range from classical to jazz to folk to death metal, though he will happily admit to being particularly fond of anything associated with the 1980s. He is a capable guitarist and amateur mixing engineer, and laments not having the living space in which to build his own instruments and amplifiers.
